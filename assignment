Assignment: Implement a Task Management System

Description:
You are tasked with developing a task management system that allows users to create, update, and manage tasks. The system should have the following features:

User Registration and Authentication:

Users should be able to register an account and log in using their credentials.
Passwords should be securely stored and encrypted.
Task Creation and Management:

Users should be able to create new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
Tasks should be editable and deletable.
Users should be able to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
Implement a search functionality to find tasks based on various criteria (e.g., title, due date).
Task Assignment and Collaboration:

Users should be able to assign tasks to other registered users.
Implement a notification system to alert users when they are assigned a task or when task deadlines are approaching.
Task Categories and Filters:

Users should be able to categorize tasks into different categories (e.g., personal, work, study).
Provide filtering options to display tasks based on categories or status (complete/incomplete).
User Interface and User Experience:

Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the task management system.
Ensure proper error handling and validation for user inputs.
Implement appropriate feedback and notifications to keep users informed.
Requirements:

Use a suitable programming language and framework of your choice.
Implement proper data storage and retrieval mechanisms (e.g., database, file system).
Write clean, well-structured, and commented code.
Include relevant unit tests to validate the functionality of your system.
Deliverables:

Source code of your task management system.
Documentation explaining your system's architecture, functionality, and installation instructions.
Submission:
Submit your source code and documentation as a compressed file (e.g., ZIP) through the online course platform.

Note: This is just one example of a software engineering homework assignment. The specifics may vary depending on the course and instructor requirements.
